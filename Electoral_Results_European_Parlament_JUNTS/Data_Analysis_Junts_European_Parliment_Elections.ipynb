    "In order to provide some context about this party let me explain what is Junts. *Junts per Catalunya* (together for Catalonia) is a political party in Catalonia (Spain) that stands for catalan independence; that is, Catalonia becoming a country separated from Spain. This party, created in 2020, can be considered the successor of the Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT).\n",
    "Currently, one of the main and most influential people in the party is [Carles Puigdemont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont), the former catalan president, who played a key role in the [2017 Catalan ilegal independe referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Catalan_independence_referendum)."

    "In order to contextualize this theory we first have to understand the current distribution of the Spanish Parliament. The current spanish government, composed of a coallition between [PSOE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Socialist_Workers%27_Party), [Sumar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumar_(electoral_platform)) and the consent of smaller political groups, depends on the \"yes\" of Junts in order to pass many laws (176 diputees to say \"yes\" in order to achieve absolute majority). In other words, **Junts holds the key of the government**, since it could also allow the opposition to rule the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the CIS, the Center of Sociological Investigations of Spain, the last report on vote intention polls showed that Junts would [most likely get one eurodeputy](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20240523/barometro-cis-elecciones-europeas-encuesta-estimacion-voto/16116057.shtml), with a real **chance of getting no representation**, which would mean a loss of two to three eurodeputys with respect to the previous elections in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the theory behind an \"election rig\" becomes easy to understand (this article does not intend the reader to agree with it, just to comprehend its main argument): since the spanish government needs Junts to stay in the government and Junts has a chance of losing representation in the eurochamber, if the government *somehow* doesn't help Junts, Junts will stop helping the government. So, the government must have done something to discretely *boost* Junts results in this elections. This could be an explanation of these strange results, since [Junts almost got two eurodeputys](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20240609/junts-ue-pierde-dos-eurodiputados-elecciones/16140167.shtml) in the elections."

In order to do so, we will make use of the publicly available dataset of the [*Area of downloads*](https://infoelectoral.interior.gob.es/es/elecciones-celebradas/area-de-descargas/) of the *Ministerio de Interior* of Spain.\n",
