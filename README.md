# Data-Analysis-for-Junts-results-in-the-European-Elections-2024

Between the 6th and the 9th of June 2024, European Parliament elections were held across Europe member states. Particularly in Spain, this elections happened on the 9th of June 2024. The results of them are [publicly known](https://results.elections.europa.eu/en/). Nevertheless, something seeminingly strange happened in the results of the Spanish elections, and it has to deal with the results obtained by the political
party [Junts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Catalonia_(2020)), which has been the **most voted party in several locations outside of Catalonia**, as it can be appreciated in [this applet provided by RTVE](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20240610/elecciones-europeas-2024-mapa-resultados-calle/16135532.shtml). 
Can we say something about this unexpected result? Can this imply that the **election system in Spain has been rigged** in favour of this party? Well, let's see what publicly available data can tell us.
